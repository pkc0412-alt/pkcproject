# **🎉 PKC Benchmark Tool (Transitioning from Private to Public)**

**TL;DR**: I am preparing to release a benchmark tool to the world, spun off from a local multimodal chatbot (2060 SUPER) project that I've been personally building for the past 2 months, with a "they'll figure it out" attitude. Here's a little sneak peek.

## **🚨 WARNING: This is still a work-in-progress project**

**"If you're expecting perfect software, please press the back button."**

This project is being developed with the following philosophy:

* ✅ It's good enough for my use.  
* ✅ It might be helpful to someone someday.  
* ❌ Even upon release, I do not guarantee it will work perfectly in every environment.  
* ❌ I will not be operating a 24-hour customer support center.  
* 🤷‍♂️ After it's public, if it doesn't run on your computer, please fork it and fix it yourself.

## **🎯 The Miracle of One-Click (The Goal)**

This is being prepared for those who think, **"Python? Virtual environment? What's that?"**:

The goal is a simple one-click installation. When released, it will work like this:

### **For Windows Users**

1. Double-click OneClick\_RUN.bat  
2. ☕ Wait while having a cup of coffee  
3. A browser will open automatically  
4. Done

*(Similar simple processes for macOS and Linux users will also be included.)*

All installations will happen inside a dedicated jail called .pkc-venv, so **your system will be safe**.

## **🤖 What's Been Made: The History of Evolution**

| Version | Status | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| v4 | 🧠 | "Just detect the GPU automatically\!" → Added auto-selection for CUDA/MPS/CPU. |
| v5 | 🎯 | "How can a non-expert use this if it's not one-click?" → Automated the virtual environment. |
| v5.3 | 💅 | "The UI is too clunky." → Slimmed down and right-aligned the input fields. |
| v5.4 | 📝 | "One prompt isn't enough." → Expanded to 3 fields. |
| v5.5 | 🌐 | "What about non-Korean speakers?" → Auto-detects browser language. |
| v5.6 | 🚀 | "Throw in all the F1 features\!" → Integrated HuggingFace search/download. |

## **🚀 Roadmap & How to Participate**

## **🎭 A Developer's Candid Confession**

### **Me, 2 months ago:**

*"Hey AI, just make me a chatbot that fits my PC specs."*

### **Me, now:**

*"Somehow I ended up making a benchmark tool... It's a waste to use it alone, so I should prepare to release it."*

### **Me, in the future (probably):**

*"Why did I release this..."*

## **📞 Contact & Updates**

The project is not yet public, but if you have questions or want to receive updates, feel free to contact me anytime.

## **🎪 One Last Word**

This tool is not "perfect software."  
It's just a "work in progress."  
Please keep an eye on it, and get ready to welcome this tool made with a "they'll figure it out" spirit.  
**Made with ❤️ and lots of ☕ by PKC**

*"Let's release it even if it's not perfect, and evolve it to be usable on common specs."*

**P.S.** I firmly believe that once the repository is public, someone will write a better announcement than this one and send me a PR. lol
